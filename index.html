        <h3>An Alaskan Upbringing</h3>
        <p>I was born July 22nd, 1989, in Anchorage Alask to Bill in Tina Hammer.  I spent my early year living in Cordova, a small fishing village south of Anchorage, in the middle of the Copper River Delta.  I attended the only school in town, where I developed an interst in computers and technology, but mostly for personal use.  My interests mainly included acting and singing, both of which i participated in through our school, and our local theater group, The Stage of the Tide.  I helped my father on his commercial fishing boat in Prince William Sound, and eventually came with him to Bristol Bay.  At 16, I was certified through American Red Cross as a lifeguard, and was hired on at the Bob Korn Memorial Swimming Pool.  At the age of 18, I began running his fishing operation in Bristol Bay alone, only taking two deckhands to help.  My summers were spent fishing, and I worked at the pool during the winter.</p>
        <p>After graduating, I moved to Fairbanks to attend the University of Alaska.  I took several acting courses there and realized I was not interested in pursuing acting as a career.  Without direction, I dropped out of college and focused on being a commercial fisherman.</p>

        <h3>A Change of Pace</h3>
        <p>After 8 years of living in Fairbanks while fishing in the summer, I decided I was unhappy with my life.  Commercial fishing is an increadibly demanding job, and the stresson both my mind and body had begun to show, despite my young age.  Income was an issue as well.  I had gotten married and wanted to start a family, but could not count on a steady flow of income.  Some seasons were great, and I could easily make equal to most yearly saleries in the span of two months.  However a failed fishing season could leave you walking away from your boat in debt.</p>
        <p>I returned to Cordova and took on the position of Pool Manager at our cities pool, where I had worked in high school.  The pay was good, I had great benifits, and many of my coworkers were friends.  As time went on however, the postion became a source of stress in my life.  Our town ran out of money after a poor fishing season, and chose to heavily cut funding from our Parks and Recreation department.  Many of the changes that took place were seen as a failure to properly manage the pool on my part, and made life in a small difficult for me.</p>

        <h3>A New Start</h3>
        <p>Wanting to make a change, I began exploring new fields of work.  Matt Jones, a friend of mine in the tech industry, suggested taking a coding bootcapm course.  Matt had grown up with me in Cordova, and had also gone to college in Fairbanks.  I trusted his advice and began searching for a program that would fit well with what i needed.  Together Matt and I found a program called Epicodus.  It offered an exciting coding program and required no prior experience.</p>
        <p>On a Tuesday afternoon I applied from my phone out of curiosity.  I recieved a responce almost immediatly and scheduled an interview with an Epicodus representitive.  I was accepted into the program and began making plans to move from Alaska to Washington, despite not having much of an idea what I was getting myself into.  With the full support of my wife, family, and friends I moved to Seattle the day before our first day of instruction.  Having never taken public transportation in my life, I somehow found my way downtown to the Epicodus office, and began my new life.</p>
